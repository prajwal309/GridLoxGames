        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>Bagchal, a traditional Nepali board game, is a strategy game where players take the role of either tigers or goats. The objective of the game varies depending on the role. The game represents a battle between tigers (the predators) and goats (the prey) on a five-pointed grid resembling a cross.</p>

        <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
        <ul class="rules-list">
            <li>Bagchal is played on a 5x5 point board, with 4 tigers and 20 goats.</li>
            <li>The goal of the tigers is to "capture" 5 goats by jumping over them.</li>
            <li>The goal of the goats is to trap the tigers, making it impossible for them to move.</li>
            <li>Players take turns: one player controls the tigers, and the other controls the goats.</li>
            <li>The tigers start at the four corners of the board. The goats start off the board.</li>
            <li>The goat player places one goat on the board per turn, while the tiger player can move one tiger per turn.</li>
            <li>Once all goats are placed, they can move to adjacent points along the lines on the board.</li>
            <li>A tiger captures a goat by jumping over it to an adjacent vacant point.</li>
            <li>Tigers cannot jump over other tigers, and goats cannot jump over anything.</li>
            <li>The game ends when the tigers capture 5 goats or when all tigers are trapped and unable to move.</li>
        </ul>
