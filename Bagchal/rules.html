    Bagchal is a traditional game played in Nepal played between two players.

    There are 25 squares originally, four tigers and upto 20 goats.

    In the following we define the rules for the tiger and the goats:

    <h2> Rules for Tigers: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> They can move to an adjacent free position along the lines.  </li>
        <li> They must leave the board when captured. </li>
        <li> They cannot jump over tigers or other goats.  </li>
    </ul>

        <li> They can move to an adjacent free position along the lines.  </li>
        <li> They can capture goats during any move, and do not need to wait until all goats are placed.  </li>
        <li> They can capture only one goat at a time.  </li>
